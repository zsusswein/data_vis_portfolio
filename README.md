# data_vis_portfolio


This portfolio was the final project for a data visualization class in my sophomore year of college, MATH-225: Data Visualization &amp; Graphics. The class was my first introduction to R code and I have since gone back and cleaned it up a bit. The graphs remain largely unchanged.
